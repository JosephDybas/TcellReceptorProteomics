# TcellReceptorProteomics

This repository contains R scripts that are used to analyze the data associated with the study Dybas et al.

The scripts accept
1) normalized log2 transformed whole cell proteomics mass spectrometry data.
2) normalized log2 transformed di-glycine remnant profile mass spectrometry data.
3) normalized log2 transformed RNAseq data with statistical analysis performed (ex. DESeq2)

The scripts are working code but the associated data will be included upon publication.
Proteomics and RNAseq data can be made available upon request.
